# Contributing

`CounterfactualExplanations.jl` is designed to be scalable: through multiple dispatch and modularization we hope to make it as straight-forward as possible for members of the community to contribute to its functionality. At the moment we are primarily looking for the following contributions:

1. Additional counterfactual generators.
2. Additional predictive models.
3. More examples to be added to the documentation.

We are also interested in suggestions on how to adjust and improve the inner workings of our package. To facilitate this process the following page explain and justify the package architecture and the design choices we have made.
