# Using `CounterfactualExplanations.jl`

The following pages introduce the main package functionality through various illustrative examples involving synthetic data. Among other things, the tutorials cover binary classification, multi-class problem and language interoperability with Python and R. For anyone primarily interested in using and understanding the existing package functionality, these tutorials should provide sufficient detail. If you are interested in contributing your own custom generators and models or have ideas for how to improve this package, we encourage you to also take a look at the Contributor's Guide.
