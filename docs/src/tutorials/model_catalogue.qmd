# Model Catalogue

While in general it is assumed that users will use this package to explain their pre-trained models, we provide a simple API call to train the following simple default models:

- Linear Classifier (Logistic Regression)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (Deep Neural Network)
- Deep Ensemble

Through optional arguments, users can control the neural network architecture and impose regularization through dropout.
