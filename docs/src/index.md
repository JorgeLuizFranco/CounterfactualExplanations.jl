`CounterfactualExplanations.jl` is a package for generating Counterfactual Explanations (CE) and Algorithmic Recourse (AR) for black-box algorithms. Both CE and AR are related tools for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While the package is written purely in Julia, it can be used to explain machine learning algorithms developed and trained in other popular programming languages like Python and R. See below for a short introduction and other resources or dive straight into the [docs](https://pat-alt.github.io/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/dev).

## Installation üö©

You can install the stable release from [Julia‚Äôs General Registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) as follows:

``` julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("CounterfactualExplanations")
```

`CounterfactualExplanations.jl` is under active development. To install the development version of the package you can run the following command:

``` julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/pat-alt/CounterfactualExplanations.jl")
```

## ü§î Background and Motivation

Machine learning models like Deep Neural Networks have become so complex, opaque and underspecified in the data that they are generally considered Black Boxes. Nonetheless, such models often play a key role in data-driven decision-making systems. This creates the following problem: human operators in charge of such systems have to rely on them blindly, while those individuals subject to them generally have no way of challenging an undesirable outcome:

## üîÆ Enter: Counterfactual Explanations

Counterfactual Explanations can help human stakeholders make sense of the systems they develop, use or endure: they explain how inputs into a system need to change for it to produce different decisions. Explainability benefits internal as well as external quality assurance.

Counterfactual Explanations have a few properties that are desirable in the context of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). These include:

- Full fidelity to the black-box model, since no proxy is involved.
- No need for (reasonably) interpretable features as opposed to LIME and SHAP.
- Clear link to Algorithmic Recourse and Causal Inference.
- Less susceptible to adversarial attacks than LIME and SHAP.

### Example: Give Me Some Credit

Consider the following real-world scenario: a retail bank is using a black-box model trained on their clients‚Äô credit history to decide whether they will provide credit to new applicants. To simulate this scenario, we have pre-trained a binary classifier on the publically available Give Me Some Credit dataset that ships with this package (Kaggle 2011).

The figure below shows counterfactuals for 10 randomly chosen individuals that would have been denied credit initially.

### Example: MNIST

The figure below shows a counterfactual generated for an image classifier trained on MNIST: in particular, it demonstrates which pixels need to change in order for the classifier to predict 4 instead of 9.

The counterfactual was produced using REVISE (Joshi et al. 2019):

``` julia
# Define generator:
generator = REVISEGenerator(
  opt = Descent(0.1),
  decision_threshold = 0.95,
  Œª = 0.01
)
# Generate recourse:
ce = generate_counterfactual(x, target, counterfactual_data, M, generator)
```

![](index_files/figure-commonmark/cell-10-output-1.svg)

## üîç Usage example

Generating counterfactuals will typically look like follows.

We have some pre-trained model that was fitted to data:

``` julia
# Data and Classifier:
counterfactual_data = load_linearly_separable(1000)
M = fit_model(counterfactual_data, :Linear)
```

For some individual and target outcome, we want to understand what a valid counterfactual in the target class looks like:

``` julia
# Randomly selected factual:
x = select_factual(counterfactual_data,rand(1:size(counterfactual_data.X,2)))
y = predict_label(M, counterfactual_data, x)[1]
target = counterfactual_data.y_levels[counterfactual_data.y_levels .!= y][1]
```

To this end, we specify a counterfactual generator of our choice:

``` julia
# Counterfactual search:
generator = DiCEGenerator(
  opt = Descent(0.01)
)
```

Here, we have chosen to use the `DiCEGenerator` to move the individual from its factual label 2 to the target label 1.

With all of our ingredients specified, we finally generate counterfactuals using a simple API call:

``` julia
ce = generate_counterfactual(
  x, target, counterfactual_data, M, generator; 
  num_counterfactuals=3
)
```

The animation below shows the resulting counterfactual path:

## Implemented Counterfactual Generators:

Currently, the following counterfactual generators are implemented:

- Generic (Wachter, Mittelstadt, and Russell 2017)
- Greedy (Schut et al. 2021)
- DiCE (Mothilal, Sharma, and Tan 2020)
- Latent Space Search as in REVISE (Joshi et al. 2019) and CLUE (Antor√°n et al. 2020)
- ClaPROAR (Altmeyer et al. 2023)
- GravitationalGenerator (Altmeyer et al. 2023)

## üéØ Goals and limitations

The goal of this library is to contribute to efforts towards trustworthy machine learning in Julia. The Julia language has an edge when it comes to trustworthiness: it is very transparent. Packages like this one are generally written in pure Julia, which makes it easy for users and developers to understand and contribute to open-source code. Eventually, this project aims to offer a one-stop-shop of counterfactual explanations. We want to deliver a package that is at least at par with the [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-recourse/CARLA) Python library in terms of its functionality. Currently, the package falls short of this goal in some ways:

1.  The number of counterfactual generators is still limited.
2.  Mutability constraints are still not supported for Latent Space generators.

Additionally, our ambition is to enhance the package through the following features:

4.  Language interoperability with Python and R: currently still only experimental.
5.  Support for machine learning models trained in [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/).
6.  Additional datasets for testing, evaluation and benchmarking.
7.  Support for regression models.
