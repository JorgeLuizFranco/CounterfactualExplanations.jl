# AlgorithmicRecourse

Documentation for [AlgorithmicRecourse.jl](https://github.com/pat-alt/AlgorithmicRecourse.jl).

A package for counterfactual explanations (CE) and algorithmic recourse (AR) in Julia. The former (CE) is a common approach towards explaining machine learning models. The latter (AR) uses counterfactual explanations to systematically provide recourse to individuals faced with an undesirable algorithmic outcome.
