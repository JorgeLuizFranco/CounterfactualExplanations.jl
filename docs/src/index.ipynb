Both CE and AR are related tools for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). While the package is written purely in Julia, it can be used to explain machine learning algorithms developed and trained in other popular programming languages like Python and R.

        "Machine learning models like Deep Neural Networks have become so complex, opaque and underspecified in the data that they are generally considered Black Boxes. Nonetheless, such models often play a key role in data-driven decision-making systems. This creates the following problem: human operators in charge of such systems have to rely on them blindly, while those individuals subject to them generally have no way of challenging an undesirable outcome:\n",

        "Counterfactual Explanations can help human stakeholders make sense of the systems they develop, use or endure: they explain how inputs into a system need to change for it to produce different decisions. Explainability benefits internal as well as external quality assurance.  \n",

        "- Full fidelity to the black-box model, since no proxy is involved. \n",
        "- No need for (reasonably) interpretable features as opposed to LIME and SHAP.\n",
        "- Clear link to Algorithmic Recourse and Causal Inference.\n",
        "- Less susceptible to adversarial attacks than LIME and SHAP.\n",

        "- Generic [@wachter2017counterfactual]\n",
        "- Greedy [@schut2021generating]\n",
        "- DiCE [@mothilal2020explaining]\n",

        "## 🎯 Goals and limitations \n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this library is to contribute to efforts towards trustworthy machine learning in Julia. The Julia language has an edge when it comes to trustworthiness: it is very transparent. Packages like this one are generally written in pure Julia, which makes it easy for users and developers to understand and contribute to open-source code. Eventually, this project aims to offer a one-stop-shop of counterfactual explanations. We want to deliver a package that is at least at par with the [CARLA](https://github.com/carla-recourse/CARLA) Python library in terms of its functionality. Currently, the package falls short of this goal in some ways: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. The number of counterfactual generators is still limited.\n",
        "2. Mutability constraints are still not supported for Latent Space generators. \n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, our ambition is to enhance the package through the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Language interoperability with Python and R: currently still only experimental. \n",
        "5. Support for machine learning models trained in [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/).\n",
        "6. Additional datasets for testing, evaluation and benchmarking.\n",
        "7. Support for regression models.\n",

        "- You're experienced with Julia and are happy to help someone less experienced to up their game. Ideally, you are also curious about Trustworthy AI.\n",
        "- You're new to Julia and open-source development and would like to start your learning journey by contributing to a recent and active development. Ideally, you are familiar with machine learning.\n",
